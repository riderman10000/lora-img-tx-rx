This is a repo to work on image transmit using LoRA technology. 

Using heltech's MCU and ESP32, which is connected to LoRA and Display.
Image is sent from Heltec to ESP32. 

The binary information to send is generated by using the `./python_image_scripts/image_to_arduinosh1106_bits_gen.py`
```bash
python ./python_image_scripts/image_to_arduinosh1106_bits_gen.py
```
It will output a binary encoded values in terminal, copy those value to `./heltec_lora_sender/mem_image.h`

```c
static const byte image_in_mem[] =  //PROGMEM 
{ 
    B00000000,B00000000,B00000000,B00000011,B11100000,B00000000,B00000000,B00000000, //8 
    B00000000,B00000000,B00000000,B00001111,B11110000,B00000000,B00000000,B00000000, //16
    ...
}
```

and in the `heltech_lora_sender.ino`. Edit the following...
```c
  if (image_number == 0){ //remove the image number later
    for(int i = 0; i < (sizeof(image)/sizeof(byte)); i++ )
        image[i] = image_in_mem[i];
  }
```
